# Welcome to Compass

Compass is a social media website where users can interact with each other by creating, sharing and interacting with itineraries in order to plan future trips or share past experiences. This allows for people to connect  and make the best decisions depending on the users needs and wants, taking into account the location, price and type of trip (backpacking, luxury travel, exploring, etc.)
