## Background and Overview
- When traveling, it is challenging figuring out how to have the most productive/fun trip possible. Finding which restaurants, understanding the transportation system and which activities are worthwhile are questions people ask themselves whenever visiting a new city.
- Compass is an app primarily built with the MERN stack where users can share, compare, and plan itineraries to facilitate the planning stages when traveling to new cities.


## Functionality and MVP
- User Auth
- Itinerary
  - CRUD (create, update, delete, index, show) 
  - Scrollable timeline
